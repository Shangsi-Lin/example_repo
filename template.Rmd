```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

## subsection

### subsubsection

This is going to make a plot
ctrl+alt+i to create code chunks
need to load libraries every time knit
# "echo = false" to hide code in viewer 
# "eval = false" to hide result
# {r name_of_the_chunk}

```{r chunk_scatterplot}
plot_df =
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n=1000),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(n = 1000)
  )

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```
